//! ObjectFile — the reference-counted existence handle owned by `LoValue`.
//!
//! An `ObjectFile` represents one Tiered-mode object's *on-disk existence*: its
//! identity (`ObjectId`, from which the file path is derived) and the NVMe bytes it
//! accounts for. Objects are immutable and versioned: each write or copy creates a
//! new `ObjectFile` with a monotonically-increasing `ObjectId` (a new version),
//! and `LoValue` always references the latest one. The keyspace `LoValue` holds an
//! `Arc<ObjectFile>`, and so does every in-flight request that resolved the key. When
//! the last reference drops (`ObjectFile::Drop`) that version is gone: we deregister
//! its read fd from the `FdPool` and unlink the NVMe file.
//!
//! Safety of deletion under a concurrent read rests on two facts:
//!   1. Reference counting on two independent Arcs — a reader pins `Arc<ObjectFile>`
//!      (existence) AND holds an `Arc<OwnedFd>` clone (the open fd). Neither the file
//!      nor its fd can be reclaimed while that reader is alive, no matter which thread
//!      drops the last ObjectFile ref (a tokio worker, a lazyfree BIO thread, or the
//!      main thread on a synchronous free).
//!   2. The keyspace lookup and removal are both serialized on the main event-loop
//!      thread, so a reader either resolves the key *before* it is unlinked — taking
//!      pins that outlive the delete — or *after*, seeing it already gone. This holds
//!      for async/lazyfree deletes too: Valkey unlinks the key on the main thread and
//!      frees the value object off-thread afterward.
//!
//! Teardown (pool deregister + unlink) runs inline on whichever thread dropped the
//! last ref, except on the main event-loop thread, where blocking would stall the
//! server, so it is handed to the tokio worker pool (see `crate::is_main_thread`).
//!
//! `ObjectFile` is Tiered-mode-only (DRAM-only mode has no NVMe file). It has no
//! serialized form; on load a handle is reconstructed for the existing file and its
//! fd opens lazily on the first GET.
